	cooler and after it can be converted to cooling capacity), long live
	tests and quality control for compressors. The advantages of a fully

	are controlled by means of throttle valves. The power of compression
	is rejected to cooling water in a full condensation heat exchanger
	which normally operates close to ambient temperature. The refrigerant
	flow is divided and the smaller part, generally less than one third,
	passes through the heat exchanger, while the greater part bypasses
	it as vapour. The two streams are re-combined by adiabatic mixing.
	Brief details are given of such a load stand which has been built
	recently, together with initial operating experiences.},

  abstract = {The term "performance of a compressor" means different things to different
	people in the compressor industry in general. For instance, isothermal
	efficiency, adiabatic efficiency, mechanical efficiency, clearance
	volumetric efficiency, overall volumetric efficiency are some of
	the terms most commonly used in the air and gas compressor industry
	[1]. In the refrigeration and air conditioning industry, some of
	the most common terms used to indicate the compressor performance
	are coefficient of performance (COP), energy efficiency ratio (EER),
	performance factor, and relative efficiency, besides other less common
	terms such as compression efficiency, volumetric efficiency, and
	mechanical efficiency, etc. [2,3]. None of these definitions of performance
	either combined together or separately give the total picture of
	the performance of the compressor. The multiplicity of these definitions
	creates a lot of confusion in analyzing the performance of a compressor,
	especially if one were to compare the performance of two different
	designs of compressors. We will attempt to concentrate on the compressor
	by proposing a new term, which we define as Efficiency of Performance
	(np), that should take into consideration every factor that can affect
	the performance of a compressor. A methodology will be developed
	to analyze and obtain np. Relationship between np, COP, and EER will
	be established and an experimental set-up to obtain np will be described.
	The analysis will be carried out only for refrigerating compressors,
	although with slight modification it will be applicable to air and
	gas compressors as well.},

  date = {2007},
  language = {English},
  month = {August},
  pages = {59-69},
  abstract = {Detailed performance analysis of centrifugal compressors in the field
	is essential to evaluate their existing condition. Current performance
	of a compressor can also be a valuable tool in evaluating its reliabiiity.
	A decrease in compressor performance can be an excellent indication
	of internal wear or fouling, which, if allowed to continue, may result
	in unscheduled outages or reduced throughput. In contrast, perceived
	performance problems may be a result of a compressor operating far
	trom its original design. However, obtaining accurate performance
	data in the field can be very challenging. This article will explain
	the relative importance that different process variables have in
	performance calculations, as well as specify the necessary instrumentation
	to obtain process data with an acceptable uncertainty. Since original
	design conditions almost never match actual operating conditions,
	how to compare actual field data to design data using nondimensional
	head and efficiency will be demonstrated. Likewise, the limits on
	these comparisons will be outlined for users. Several example field
	performance evaluations are discussed with some common pitfalls that
	can be avoided. Examples of the effects of inaccurate process data
	are also included in the discussion.},
