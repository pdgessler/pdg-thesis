The main components of the plant are: the compressor to be tested, a water cooled heat exchanger, an expansion valve and a refrigerant vessel. The test bench can be used for: performance evaluation of the compressor (refrigerant flow rate can be found on a heat balance on the gas cooler and after it can be converted to cooling capacity), long live tests and quality control for compressors. The advantages of a fully gas cycle are: low energy consumption refrigerant charge of the plant, small inertia of the plant.},

  Abstract                 = {A refrigerant compressor load stand is described and a theoretical analysis of its operation is presented. The purpose of the load stand is to establish and maintain pre-determined values of the suction pressure, the discharge pressure and the suction superheat. These are controlled by means of throttle valves. The power of compression is rejected to cooling water in a full condensation heat exchanger which normally operates close to ambient temperature. The refrigerant flow is divided and the smaller part, generally less than one third, passes through the heat exchanger, while the greater part bypasses it as vapour. The two streams are re-combined by adiabatic mixing. Brief details are given of such a load stand which has been built recently, together with initial operating experiences.},

  Abstract                 = {The term "performance of a compressor" means different things to different people in the compressor industry in general. For instance, isothermal efficiency, adiabatic efficiency, mechanical efficiency, clearance volumetric efficiency, overall volumetric efficiency are some of the terms most commonly used in the air and gas compressor industry [1]. In the refrigeration and air conditioning industry, some of the most common terms used to indicate the compressor performance are coefficient of performance (COP), energy efficiency ratio (EER), performance factor, and relative efficiency, besides other less common terms such as compression efficiency, volumetric efficiency, and mechanical efficiency, etc. [2,3]. None of these definitions of performance either combined together or separately give the total picture of the performance of the compressor. The multiplicity of these definitions creates a lot of confusion in analyzing the performance of a compressor, especially if one were to compare the performance of two different designs of compressors. We will attempt to concentrate on the compressor by proposing a new term, which we define as Efficiency of Performance (np), that should take into consideration every factor that can affect the performance of a compressor. A methodology will be developed to analyze and obtain np. Relationship between np, COP, and EER will be established and an experimental set-up to obtain np will be described. The analysis will be carried out only for refrigerating compressors, although with slight modification it will be applicable to air and gas compressors as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Detailed performance analysis of centrifugal compressors in the field is essential to evaluate their existing condition. Current performance of a compressor can also be a valuable tool in evaluating its reliabiiity. A decrease in compressor performance can be an excellent indication of internal wear or fouling, which, if allowed to continue, may result in unscheduled outages or reduced throughput. In contrast, perceived performance problems may be a result of a compressor operating far trom its original design. However, obtaining accurate performance data in the field can be very challenging. This article will explain the relative importance that different process variables have in performance calculations, as well as specify the necessary instrumentation to obtain process data with an acceptable uncertainty. Since original design conditions almost never match actual operating conditions, how to compare actual field data to design data using nondimensional head and efficiency will be demonstrated. Likewise, the limits on these comparisons will be outlined for users. Several example field performance evaluations are discussed with some common pitfalls that can be avoided. Examples of the effects of inaccurate process data are also included in the discussion.},
